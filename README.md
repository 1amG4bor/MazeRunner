# MazeRunner
This project **'will'** make a platform independent desktop game application. Currently it is a 2D top-down view (¾) RPG-like game that is played in a randomly generated labyrinth.
For the graphic display I used some freeware sprite, pixel-Art and graphics-set drafts.
*(These will be listed in the end of the page)*

## Backlog to Featur

 - [x] Create the gameboard with recursive generate algorithm
 - [x] Draw board in terminal than draw it  with java.awt.Graphics2D API
 - [x] Implement the moving in the maze with validation
 - [ ] Refactor the whole project & create MVP-model for the next generation display
 - [ ] Create 'Factories' to make the board and the  characters
 - [ ] Implement minimal AI to create moving and fighting behavior for the enemy non-player character.
 - [ ] Draw the map and characters with Java Swing API (top-down view)
 - [ ] New Graphics design (avatar + hud / new textures)
 - [ ] More and more behavior pattern for NPC
 - [ ] Different enemy types
