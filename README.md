# MazeRunner
This project will make a platform independent desktop game application. Currently it is a 2D top-down view (¾) RPG-like game that is played in a randomly generated labyrinth.
For the graphic display I used some freeware sprite, pixel-Art and graphics-set drafts. * (These will be listed in the end of the page) *
