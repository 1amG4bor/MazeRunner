# Maze Runner
This project **'will'** make a platform independent desktop game application. Currently it is a 2D top-down view (¾) RPG-like game that is played in a randomly generated labyrinth.
For the graphic display I used some freeware sprite, pixel-Art and graphics-set drafts.
*(These will be listed in the end of the page)*
